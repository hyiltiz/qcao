I have to learn to sleep on time. I think a full cycle of my circadian
rhythm is well over the period of the earth (people tell me that is
called 24h). For my poor body, a day seems 27h. 

I should tame my body so I can live as normal people, as her. I would
wake up as she does, and close my eyes and fly in my dreamland when she
does so as well.
