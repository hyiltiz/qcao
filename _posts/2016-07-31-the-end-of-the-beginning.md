TODO: Too tired today, and will have to pick up soon before these
memories, one of the best yet, starts to wither away.

Let's put down keywords first. 

Before 'n' after. the quarter. Union square. Associated supermarket. (no) apple. lemon-flavored ice cream. hunger. chocolates. cooking. seasonings. tasting the dish. record. password. domino tower.

passion, reason, choice and love.

warmth, tenderness, love and respect.

a glimpse of a sense of guilt: a clearer way could've cleared the mist;
live in clear ways and utter in clear forms. To be understood by those
beloved ones is bliss, not to be trapped by withering laurels. 


H2O, D2O, clouds/mist, rain/water and ice/crystals. 

unix vs. linux (to be continued). staying together? Not so
amazed/special? 闯入?

bad trains. late night.
