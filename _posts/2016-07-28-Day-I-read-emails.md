All of a sudden, she told me that she didn't break up. i assured her
that i did break up. i felt devastated; did our mutual friend told her
about me how i felt that day? 

Later, i found out that i worried too much, and apologized for my
outrage from our mutual friend. 

Broccoli, durian, sea food and veggies. 弹琴 led to 久石让, which led to
Spirited Away, and she said she will sing its theme song for me. She
showed me how sunset looks like from her building. She asked whether i
could sense she was sad, and confirmed that she was a little bit. i will
figure out tomorrow.

We will:
 1. eat durian (or durian flavored cookies), 
 2. watch Spirited Away in a cinema, 
 3. watch the sunset from her building, 
 4. listen to her singing the Spirited Away's theme song,
 5. listen to me reading The Lonely Songs of Larren Dorr.

i continued writing my journal, paying attention to becoming a healthy
adult psychologically. i started doing my push-ups and sit-ups, and was
better than half a year ago. i came up with a list of things i shall
have to do (and i have to do those soon). 

One very important issue is almost settled: i read all of the emails
sent to my personal email and finished reading almost all of the work
emails. i will read the rest tomorrow, and reply. And hunt for an
apartment to rent.

A new life awaits. 

Just as 千, i have lost my name to some unknown entity. Now is the time
to fight back and 寻 for it. 

Who am i?
